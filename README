# Reservation system of my local tennis club

## Building, Installation and Deployment
We use the **nix** environment to build, install and deploy the
application. For local building and testing switch to a nix-shell
environment. 
```
cabal2nix . --shell > shell.nix
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=$HOME/nixpkgs --arg compiler \"ghc7103\"
```

Then you can build the application
```
cabal build
```
For the deployment there are some *.nix files to build the
application, produce an environment with a systemd service an deploy
the application to a local container or a container on a remote
server. For this process we use **nixops**.

First we create a nixops environment and deploy it to a remote server:
```
nixops create -d tclres-remote tclres-server.nix tclres-container-remote.nix
nixops deploy -d tclres-remote
```
